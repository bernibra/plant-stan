_I ~~might be have been indoctrinated in~~ __fully embrace__ Richard Mcelreath's ~~cult~~ views on statistical inference: these should not be a set of pre-made tools but instead a set of strategies._

I don't like software such as [maxent](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dismo/versions/1.1-4/topics/maxent) or [HMSC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmsc/index.html). They might be every statistician's nightmare---black boxes that help you forget about basic aspects of statistical inference. What are my priors? Why did I choose a likelihood or prior distribution over another? Why is this model better than any other? These, among others, are basic questions that any scientist should be able to confidently answer about theirÂ models. Therefore, and for the sake of my own learning, I am trying here to compare the performance of the aforementioned software and my own models writen in stan.
